## What can I do with tldraw?

You can use the [Tldraw](?) React component to embed a fully featured and extendable whiteboard in your app. See the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/tldraw-example-canary-2lrzmy) for a minimal example.

For multiplayer whiteboards, you can plug the component into the [collaboration backend](/docs/collaboration) of your choice. Check out our [Yjs example](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-yjs-example) to see how you might use tldraw together with [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/).

You can use the [Editor](?) API to create, update, and delete shapes, control the cameraâ€”or do just about anything else. You can extend tldraw with your own [custom shapes](/docs/shapes) and [custom tools](/docs/tools). You can use our [user interface](/docs/user-interface) overrides to change the contents of menus and toolbars, or else hide the UI and replace it with your own.

If you want to go even deeper, you can use the [TldrawEditor](?) component as a more minimal engine without the default tldraw shapes or user interface.
