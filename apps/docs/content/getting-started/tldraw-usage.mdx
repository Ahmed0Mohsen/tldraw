The [Tldraw](?) component is designed to be customized and extended. It combines several other elements: 
- a canvas to render shapes, controls, and overlays
- a user interface that provides tools for working with the canvas
- an [Editor](?) instance that controls the state and handles events

> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è There's a lot you can do with the [Tldraw](?) component. The best way to learn is through our [examples](/examples), which demonstrate how different props and techniques can be used together. 

## Props

You can configure the [Tldraw](?) component via its props. See the [TldrawProps](?) page for a full reference.

#### `onMount`

The `onMount` prop accepts a callback that will be fired when the component is mounted. The callback will be passed the [Editor](?) instance as its first argument.

#### `persistenceKey`

When you provide a `persistenceKey`, the state of the editor will be saved locally. It will also be syncronized between tabs, so that any window with the editor open will have its state kept in sync. See the [Persistence](/docs/persistence) page for more information.

#### `snapshot`

You can use the `snapshot` prop to set the initial data for the editor. This can be useful for loading a saved state, or for initializing the editor with a specific set of shapes. See [persistence](/docs/persistence) page for more information.

#### `forceMobile`

The `forceMobile` prop will force the editor to use the mobile layout, regardless of the user's device. This can be useful for testing the mobile layout on a desktop device.

#### `hideUi`

If you want to hide the user interface completely, set the `hideUi` prop to `true`.

#### `components`

If you want to change the way that the [Tldraw](?) component's user interface looks or behaves, you can provide overrides for the various components that it uses. See the [User Interface](/docs/user-interface) section for more information.

#### `onUiEvent`

The `onUiEvent` prop accepts a callback that is called when a user interacts with the user interface. See the [User Interface](/docs/user-interface#events) section for more information.

#### `store`

For advanced cases, you can provide the [Tldraw](?) component with a custom [Store](?) via its `store` prop. This can be useful for cases where you want to load data into a store asynchronously and then pass it to the editor.
